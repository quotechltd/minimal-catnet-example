# Minimal CatNet Example

This code lifts the relevant parts of the CatNet integration away from risks, for debugging purposes.

## Usage

Drop a catnet-registered private key into a file called `private.key`, then create a .env file with the `CATNET_CLIENT_ID` populated with the relevant client ID.

Do an `npm i` to install the dependencies, then run `npm test` to see how the integration performs.
